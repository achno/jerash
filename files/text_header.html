<!--    Archaeologists aim to understand past societies. But it is a daunting task to reconstruct these from the fragments of pots and the trash that our ancestors have left behind. Archaeology is hard!-->
One of the main goals of archaeology is to understand past societies. This not an easy task: imagine trying to tell the story of a city based on a few ceramic fragments. Here, we will show you how modelling and computer simulations can help reconstruct how people lived in the past – or at least make sense out of a bunch of broken pots.

Jerash was a city in the ancient world which flourished for several centuries from late Hellenistic times through the Roman, Byzantine and early Islamic periods. Today, what's left of Jerash makes it a great case study for understanding how an ordinary ancient city in the region worked.

The archaeological dig at Jerash unearthed many fragments of pots that fell broadly in two categories: local pots and imported pots. However, there were a lot more local pots than imported pots. In fact, more than 99% of the fragments came from local pots. Why would that be?
