	Archaeologists aim to understand past societies. But it is a daunting task to reconstruct these from the fragments of pots and the trash they have left behind. Archaeology is hard!

	<p class="lh-copy">
	Consider for example the goods we buy and consume. The traces we leave behind after consuming something (like seeds or bones remaining at the end of a meal, or fragments of a ceramic pot we bought) are a product of a lot of things: the economy, politics, religious practices but also our day-to-day choices. How then can archaeologists untangle these things? How can they study just the economic story behind these traces? How can they explore ancient individualsâ€™ personal choices that led to these archaeological traces?

	<p class="lh-copy">
	Here we will introduce an approach that can help us untangle the complexities of past human behaviour: computational modelling. It allows us to focus on individual phenomena like trade, individual preference or political regulation. By simulating their theories about these things, archaeologists can identify what evidence they would find if their theory was true, and they can test hypotheses related to their theories by comparing simulated archaeology with real excavated archaeology.

	We will explore this approach together by evaluating theories of the effect of choice and personal preference on the creation of the archaeological material found at the site of Jerash in Jordan.
