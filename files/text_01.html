	Something curious about Jerash is that almost all of the ceramic remains found here were locally produced (more than 99% of it!). This phenomenon is quite unique, especially since other urban centres in the regions show more diversity in the ceramic assemblages found there.

	There are a couple hypotheses to explain what's happening. You might think that thinking critically you might be able to figure out which one. Here we'll introduce you to a tool that can help you reason rigorously and get insights that you might not be able to get by just comparing hypotheses.

	What people buy in the market depends on their preferences and on what's available. Let's say we have two kinds of pots, blue and yellow, for the moment equally available, and the citizen prefers one more than the other. You can represent this preference on this slider:<br><br>

	This is a simulation of the broken pots that this citizen would leave behind, over their life. For instance, if it's 50%-50%, they'll probably leave a 50/50 pile of pots behind. Maybe 49/51, or 51/49. If their preference is around 75%-25%, the distribution of pots will probably be around that value as well.
