Or perhaps people just preferred buying local pots over imported pots. Imagine we could go back in time and look at a the number of pots being sold. In the simulation below move the slider to change the preference of pots and press 'PLAY':<br><br>


<!--    Let's make our first computational model of pottery preference. Say we go to the Jerash market and there are two kinds of pots, local and imported (on the left and right of the figure below). For the moment both are equally available on the market place, and the inhabitant of Jerash prefers one more than the other. Move the slider and press 'play':<br><br>-->

	This is a simple simulation of the broken pots that this buyer would leave behind over their lifetime. What happens if you set the preference in the middle, equal for both local and imported pots? You might notice that sometimes you will get 49%/51% or 51%/49%. This is because in simulations like this, the preference slider only represents a probability that a certain pot will be bought, so over many simulations, the average should be 50%/50%. What happens when the preference is around 75:25? Does the simulation behave as you expected?-->
