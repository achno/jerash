<!--    It might seem a bit simplistic to think that individual preference alone can account for the bias towards locally produced products found in Jerash. Let's consider an alternative. Suppose that Jerash potters had been making pots for a long time before imported pots were introduced in the market. This might get reflected in the archaeological record by a significant bias towards local products as they simply had more time to accumulate.-->

	We can easily add this new factor to our previous simulation using a new slider. This slider will determine how long it took for the foreign pottery to be introduced to the Jerash market. Note that if we set the time 'gap' to zero, then our simulation behaves exactly like the one above. Can you get a big discrepancy in the amount of pottery even without a strong preference towards either type of pottery?<br><br>
