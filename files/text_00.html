Perhaps pots imported from distant lands were simply not available in as high quantities in Jerashâ€™s market stalls? In the simulation below move the slider to change the availability of pots and press 'PLAY':<br><br>

	This is a simple simulation of the broken pots that this buyer would leave behind over their lifetime. What happens if you set the availability in the middle, equal for both local and imported pots? You might notice that sometimes you will get 49%/51% or 51%/49%. This is because in simulations like this, the availability slider only represents a probability that a certain pot will be bought, so over many simulations, the average should be 50%/50%. What happens when the availability is around 75:25? Does the simulation behave as you expected?
