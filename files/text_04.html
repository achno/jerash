	In this explorable explanation, we are going to address one last hypothesis where
	the bias is due to how much each type of pot was used (so the probability of each
	type of pot breaking) was different. As an analogy, this hypothesis proposes that one of pots,
	say pot A, as the daily use pot, and pot B as a pot for special occasions (e.g. fancy
	porcelain dishes). However, to consider this hypothesis we are going to have to make
	some changes in our model as we will now need to make a distinction between buying pots
	and them forming part of the archaeological record.

	<p class="lh-copy">
	We assume that the number of pots in a household is going to be constant, so when
	a pot breaks, it will be replaced by a new pot. The type of pot that is bought
	will depend on the preferences of pot type (i.e. it is not necessarily the same
	type of pot that broke). Furthermore, when a pot breaks, it will depend on how
	often that pot is used.

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	In the simulation you will see the number of pots in the house on the left,
	and the pots in the archaeological dig on the left. The number of pots
	in the house will change very quickly (*** this will change ***), but it is there
	to illustrate the difference between this scenario and the previous ones we
	have looked at so far. <br><br>
