	In this explorable explanation, we are going to address one last hypothesis whereby
	the bias is due to how much each type of pot was used (so the probability of each
	type of pot breaking) was different. As an analogy, this hypothesis places one of pots,
	say pot A, as the daily use pot, and pot B as a pot for special occasions (e.g. fancy
	porcelain dishes). However, to consider this hypothesis we are going to have to make
	some changes in our model as we will now need to make a distinction between buying pots
	and them breaking to form part of the archaeological record.
