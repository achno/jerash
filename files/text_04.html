    We are now going to address one last hypothesis. This hypothesis suggests that local pottery was used more frequently than imported pottery. This would imply a higher probability of breaking local pottery than imported pottery, which would be reflected in the overall numbers of pots in each household.

<!--differences in the frequency with which different pots were used in Jerash households. Imagine as an analogy the crockery at your grandparents’ house: some plates and cups are for everyday use and therefore have a much higher chance of breaking and being replaced with new item, whereas another set of plates and cups would be safely stored in a wooden cupboard only to be taken out at special occasions like Christmas and when the queen visits. The latter pottery would not have as much probability of breaking and being replaced simply because it is used less frequency.-->

	We could hypothesise that local Jerash pottery is overrepresented in the archaeological record because it is was used daily and was replaced more often, whereas imported pottery was used less and broke less often. To consider this hypothesis, we need to change our model to differentiate between buying a pot and breaking the pot, and we will only count broken pots.

	<p class="lh-copy">
    We assume that the number of pots in a household is going to be constant, so when a pot breaks it will be replaced by a new pot. The type of pot that is bought will depend on the preferences of pot type: i.e. the new pot bought to replace a broken pot is not necessarily of the same type as the pot that broke. The more frequently a type of pot is used, the more likely this type of pot will end up on the pile of discarded broken pots. In this model you can see on the left the number of pots in the household, and on the right you see the broken pots that are discarded and excavated by archaeologists. Try out this model by clicking the buttons to use, break and buy one pot at a time. <br><br>

	Breaking pots one by one might be fun, but it’s a bit slow so we speed things up a bit in the next simulation. Your preference for using either local or imported pottery is now represented by a slider. Each time you press 'PLAY' the model simulates the use, breaking, and buying of pots 100 times according to the slider settings (you will notice the number of pots in the house will change very quickly as the simulation breaks pots at super speed). Notice how there needs to be a really strong preference for both buying the local product and the frequency of using the local product in order to get simulation results where only 1% of the broken deposited pots is imported pottery. <br><br>

	That's it: you have just applied computer simulation to archaeological research. This explorable explanation obviously just offered a very abstract and simplified example of archaeological research, the real stuff involves much more archaeological data analysis and computer coding work. But there's a few things that will have become clear from this explanation:

	<ul>
	<li>Complex archaeological theories can be broken into little parts and formally represented.</li>
	<li>By using computer modelling we can simulate the archaeological data we would expect to see as the result of our theory.</li>
	<li>We can determine the plausibility of our archaeological theories by comparing simulated data with actual archaeological data.<br></li>
	<li>Computer modelling allows us to specify our theories, narrowing down the influence of our theories on the archaeological record (think about the graph with the parameter space: only a tiny portion of slider settings could reproduce the archaeological data even though half of the graph represented our archaeological theory).</li>
	<li>Abstracting and simplifying our archaeological theories is necessary for computer simulation to work, and it’s provocative: which is a good thing! It forces us to rethink our theories and specify or reject them.</li>
	<li>Some archaeological theories which sound simple are intuitive can turn out to have surprising counter-intuitive results. The human brain is particularly bad at forecasting the interplay between multiple theoretical scenarios in more complex models: that’s why we use computers.</li>
	<li>These simple models obviously don’t capture the full complexity of the ancient inhabitants of Jerash and their relationship with pottery. They should be seen as thought experiments to be merged with traditional quantitative and qualitative archaeological approaches.</li>
	</ul>

	Want to play around a little bit more with simulated pots and Jerash people? Here's a sandbox model that includes all variables introduced in this explorable explanation. Together they show a pretty complex theory of preference that can be explored in a formal way: <br><br>
	<!--What are your thoughts about pottery preference in Jerash? Which settings of this sandbox model seem credible and which do not? How would you expand or modify this model?-->
