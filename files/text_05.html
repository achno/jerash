<b>Here is some more information about the actual archaeological site and the ongoing research!</b>

<!--Consider for example the goods we buy and consume. The traces we leave behind after consuming something (like seeds or bones remaining at the end of a meal, or fragments of a ceramic pot we bought) are a product of a lot of things: the economy, politics, religious practices but also our day-to-day choices. How then can archaeologists untangle these things? How can they study just the economic story behind these traces? How can they explore ancient individuals’ personal choices that led to these archaeological traces?-->
<!--<p class="lh-copy">-->
<!--Here we will introduce an approach that can help us untangle the complexities of past human behaviour: computational modelling. It allows us to focus on individual phenomena like trade, individual preference or political regulation. By simulating their theories about these things, archaeologists can identify what evidence they would find if their theory was true, and they can test hypotheses related to their theories by comparing simulated archaeology with real excavated archaeology.-->

<!--We will explore this approach together by evaluating theories of the effect of choice and personal preference on the creation of the archaeological material found at the site of Jerash in Jordan.-->

	As mentioned above, ancient Gerasa, now known as Jerash, was a city in northern Jordan which flourished for several centuries from late Hellenistic times through the Roman, Byzantine and early Islamic periods. The city is known from ancient sources and is mentioned, among other ancient authors, by Pliny as being one of the Decapolis cities of the Roman period, all but one of which were located on the east side of the Jordan valley in southern Syria. Jerash was an ordinary middle-sized ancient city covering approximately 90 hectares within its Roman period city walls. Jerash had all the typical features of an ancient city including a network of streets, sanctuaries, a city council building also used as a theatre, bath complexes, market squares and domestic architecture. Later, numerous churches were constructed in Jerash, as well as one of the earliest mosques known to us. Jerash therefore makes a great case study for understanding how an ordinary ancient city in the region worked.

	Something curious about Jerash is that almost all of the ceramic remains found here were locally produced during a period of six centuries (more than 99% of it!). Have a look at this figure showing almost a million ceramic pottery shards from across the site of Jerash and dated to a period of six centuries from the Roman to the early Islamic period: just a handful are overseas or regional imports.<br>

	This phenomenon is quite unique, especially since other urban centres in the region and other Decapolis cities show more diversity in the ceramics found there.

    Apart from the hypotheses that we have already considered above, there are many other reasons that could explain this data pattern. Here are a couple of hypotheses to explain what's happening:
	<ul>
	<li>Jerash was too far away from the coast and major roads to get imports?</li>
	<li>Jerash was too small a town to be attractive to foreign traders?</li>
	<li>Jerash did not have a need for imports because it was a big producer itself?</li>
	<li>Jerash had other priorities and spent its money on different goods and projects?</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="lh-copy">
	Much like the simulations above, we can create models that can test some of these hypotheses. You might think that this is an easy and intuitive question to answer. Surely if the people of Jerash had a preference then we would just expect the local product to be far more common than the imported product. However, hopefully the examples above have convinced you that even simple theories can have unexpected and counter-intuitive results, and that this problem is magnified tenfold when we combine different theories in a single model!

	<p class="lh-copy">
	This is why we need computational modelling! To help you reason rigorously about the implications of different theories, to be able to distinguish between the effects of different theories, and to be able to say something about the probability of different theories.
