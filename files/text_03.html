	You might have started to wonder: is this just play, or whether we learn something from it? One thing that we can now ask is which combinations of purchase preference and temporal gap would explain our archaeological data.

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Before we analyse the results for our simulations above, let's talk through a very simple example. Imagine each of the two sliders only had three options. That would give us a total of nine (3x3 = 9) combinations that we could simulate, and we can visualize this as a 3x3 grid as in the figure below. At the end of each simulation we could compare our results to our data. If the simulation looks like our data, we can colour it green, and if the simulation result is very different from the data we can colour it pink.<br><br>

   In this example, knowing the value of one of our sliders is not always enough to predict whether our simulation will reproduce our data. It is the combination of slider values that really matters. How important is each slider for explaining the data? Does one slider have a bigger effect on changes in the data than another?

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Now let's see what this really looks like for our simulations when we consider the full spectrum of slider settings. On one axis you will see the values of the preference, and on the other you will see the values for the temporal gap. The colour of each point in the graph will tell you the percentage of local pottery that the model predicts: the dark green zone of slider settings predicts more than 99.8% of local pottery, whereas the dark purple zone explains less than 20%.
