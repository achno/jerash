	Hopefully, you have been having fun playing with the two simulations above. But you 
	might have started to wonder how this can be used to aid in your academic endeavours.
	In other words, is this just play, or can we learn something from it? 
	 
	<p class="lh-copy">
	So far we have been playing with two sliders: the preference of type of pots and the 
	temporal gap between each pot being available in Jerash. One thing that we might want 
	to know is what combinations of preference and temporal gap would explain our data. 

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Let's look at a very simple example. Let's say we have three different preference levels 
	(Prefers A, No preference, and Prefers B), and three different time gaps (Small, Medium, and 
	Large). Let us say that when we run the simulation we put an "X" wherever the simulation 
	is very different to what we observe in our real data, and a "O" wherever the simulation 
	is similar to what we see in our data. <br><br>

	Here we can see that there can be more than one combination of parameters that can result in 
	similar outcomes to our data, but it is important to highlight that it is the combination of parameters
	that really matters. (I will improve this text once the image is in)

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Now let's see what this looks like for our simulations. On one axis you will see the 
	values of the preference, and on the other you will see the values for the temporal 
	gap. The color of each point in the graph will tell you the percentage of local 
	pottery that the model predicts. (say more about it when it's interactive)
