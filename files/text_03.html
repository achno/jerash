	Hopefully, you have been having fun playing with the two simulations above. But you
	might have started to wonder how this can be used to aid in your academic endeavours.
	In other words, is this just play, or can we learn something from it?

	<p class="lh-copy">
	So far we have been playing with two sliders: pot preference and the
	temporal gap between the availability of each pot in Jerash. One thing that we might want
	to know is what combinations of preference and temporal gap would explain our data.

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Before we analyse the results for our simulations above, let's talk through a very
	simple example. Imagine each slider only had three options. That would give us a total
	of nine (3x3 = 9) combinations that we could simulate, and we can visualize this
	as a 3x3 grid as in the figure below. At the end of each simulation
	we could compare our results to our data. If the simulation looks like our data, we
	can colour it green, and if the simulation result is very different from the data
	we can colour it pink. <br><br>

        Hopefully, you are now feeling comfortable with reading this type of graph.
	It is important to highlight that knowing the value of one of our sliders is not
	always enough to predict whether our simulation will reproduce our data. Instead
	it is the combination of slider values that really matters. 

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Now let's see what this looks like for our simulations. On one axis you will see the
	values of the preference, and on the other you will see the values for the temporal
	gap. The color of each point in the graph will tell you the percentage of local
	pottery that the model predicts. (say more about it when it's interactive) <br><br>
