	Hopefully, you have been having fun playing with the two previous simulations. But you might have started to wonder how this can be used to aid in your academic endeavours to understand the past. In other words, is this just play, or can we learn something from it?

	<p class="lh-copy">
	So far we have been playing with two sliders: pot preference and the temporal gap between the availability of each pot in Jerash. One thing that we might want to know is what combinations of preference and temporal gap would explain our archaeological data.

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Before we analyse the results for our simulations above, let's talk through a very simple example. Imagine each of the two sliders only had three options. That would give us a total of nine (3x3 = 9) combinations that we could simulate, and we can visualize this as a 3x3 grid as in the figure below. At the end of each simulation we could compare our results to our data. If the simulation looks like our data, we can colour it green, and if the simulation result is very different from the data we can colour it pink.<br><br>

    Hopefully, after this simple example you now feel more comfortable with reading this type of graph. It is important to highlight that knowing the value of one of our sliders is not always enough to predict whether our simulation will reproduce our data. Instead it is the combination of slider values that really matters. How important is each slider (i.e. each theoretical explanation) for explaining the data? Does one slider have a bigger effect on changes in the data than another?

	<p class= "lh-copy">
	Now let's see what this really looks like for our simulations when we consider the full spectrum of slider settings, and not just 3x3 settings. On one axis you will see the values of the preference, and on the other you will see the values for the temporal gap. The colour of each point in the graph will tell you the percentage of local pottery that the model predicts: the dark green zone of slider settings explains more than 99.8% of the data pattern, whereas the dark purple zone explains less than 20%. When you hover your mouse over each of these zones you will see a little animation as an example of this combination of slider settings. <b>If you are using Firefox, the animation might not work. Try another browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, Edge).</b><br><br>
